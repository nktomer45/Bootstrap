@Welcome to Bootstrap, a powerful front-end framework for creating responsive, mobile-first websites.

Here are some key features of Bootstrap:

A responsive grid system that makes it easy to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
A wide variety of pre-designed UI components, such as navigation bars, forms, buttons, and more
Support for CSS preprocessors such as Sass
Built-in support for JavaScript plugins, such as modals and carousels
Extensive documentation and a large community of users
Getting started with Bootstrap is easy. You can include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML file, or you can use a package manager like npm to install and manage your dependencies.

You can also customize the design of your website by modifying the variables in the Sass files or creating your own CSS styles.

We recommend you to visit the official website of Bootstrap to find more details, examples and tutorials.

We hope you enjoy using Bootstrap and creating beautiful, responsive websites. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to our community or open an issue on GitHub.
